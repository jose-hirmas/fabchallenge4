# Micro Challenge 4: Integrated prototype that helps your MDEF Project and integrates the range of units covered. 

## How is this linked to my research area?

My research has focused on seeking new ways of building relationships and ‘giving voice to agents that usually do not have it’, generating awareness about critical scenarios that affect society. My work includes food culture, art, craftsmanship, migration, generating learning and sharing environments as a source of inspiration for new narratives that can impact education and social development.

Social Food Narratives is a research project that gives a new role to food, exploring the meaning behind it, for understanding culture, regenerating communities, and seeking human relationships with the world.

- Exploring food culture for understanding human relationships
- Creating new ways of bonding with and through food.
- Redefining the role of food for the future(s)

Long Term Dissemination Plan: It means how will you raise awareness of your project amongst the target group. The dissemination plan might answer questions such as: who is your project for, how is it funded, is there a license you chose or something else to protect intellectual properties of your project, is there a business plan, how would you fund scaling up, etc.
